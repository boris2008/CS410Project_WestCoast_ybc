So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close

ZAYN,5ZsFI1h6hIdQRw2ti0hz81,I Don‚Äôt Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker),2y5aJvzXhHPA94U5GFAcXe,"Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all

Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life, oh

True love will find you in the end

About an artist growing old
Some would try for fame and glory
Others aren't so bold

Everyone, and friends and family
Saying, ""Hey, get a job!""
""Why do you only do that only?
Why are you so odd?
We don't really like what you do
We don't think anyone ever will
It's a problem that you have
And this problem's made you ill""

Listen up and I'll tell a story
About an artist growing old
Some would try for fame and glory
Others aren't so bold

You should know by now the road that'll lead you down
And are you really happy in this place you've returned to again?
This isn't ever gonna have a happily ever after end

Cause you've got the smarts and the heartaches to show for
The voice and a beauty all your own
You're better off alone till your heart can find a home
But for now, until then
Know you're more than just a girlfriend

And I'm at the end of my rope
Its so tough just to be alive
When I feel like the living dead

I'm givin' it up so plain
I'm living my life in vain

I gotta really try,
Try so hard to get by
And where am I going to?

I don't know where is up or down
